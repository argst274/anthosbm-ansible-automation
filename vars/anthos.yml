# Cluster name: The name the Anthos Cluster will be registered with on GCP
# Cluster type. This can be:
#   1) admin:      to create an admin cluster. This can later be used to create user clusters.
#   2) user:       to create a user cluster. Requires an existing admin cluster.
#   3) hybrid:     to create a hybrid cluster that runs admin cluster components and user workloads.
#   4) standalone: to create a cluster that manages itself, runs user workloads, but does not manage other clusters.
# Cluster profile. This can be:
#   1) default: The default profile has limited resource requirements.
#   2) edge:    The edge profile minimizes the resource consumption of Anthos clusters on bare metal. It is only available for standalone clusters.
